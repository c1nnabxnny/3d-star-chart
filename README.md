# 3d-star-chart
a new repo for my star website project bc the other one got too messy to maintain

code structure:

1. starchart.py

This script connects to the skyfield api. Skyfield computes positions for the stars, planets, and satellites in orbit around the Earth. Its results should agree with the positions generated by the United States Naval Observatory and their Astronomical Almanac to within 0.0005 arcseconds (half a “mas” or milliarcsecond). This script scrapes data from the Hipparcos star catalogue to get the coordinates of all the stars in the database.
It converts the raw data into x,y,z coordinates that can be plotted on a scatterplot graph. Then it writes all the coordinates into a 2D array in a file called "coordinates.js". It then charts all the stars into a 3d scatterplot, however, this step was just for testing purposes to ensure the code worked, it is not necessary to include in the overall finished project.

2. passdata.py and passdata.js

This code is a two-part script that allows data to be passed between python and js scripts.
I copied this code from the following YouTube video made by Apes in Capes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSAFVMaaH-w. Check out that link if you want to understand how this code works. At this moment,  I'm not actually sure if I even need these files as I can't remember if Iused them or not in downloading the data, lol. This is why you should always write good comments and update your readme while you're working. It's been like two days and I have zero memory of writing this code and barely any understanding of how it works. lmfao.

3. coordinates.js

This file contains an extremely large 2D array of all the coordinates in the Hipparcos catalogue, which is 118,219 stars that each have 3 coordinate points (x,y,z) that are very large numbers.
